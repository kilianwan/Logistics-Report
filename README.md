# Logistic Regression Model for Breast Cancer Classification

Author: *Kilian Wan*

# Overview
This repository contains a report and Python code that demonstrate the development of a logistic regression model to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant. The model is based on data from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (Original), which contains various cellular attributes from breast mass samples.

The report covers the entire process of exploratory data analysis (EDA), model fitting, model assessment, and the presentation of the final estimated model with its coefficients and odds ratios.
